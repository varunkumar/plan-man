PlanMan is an SMS / missed call based workflow management system targeted towards a small group or company wanting to schedule daily tasks. Taking input from any type of device, in the form of missed call or SMS, PlanMan is designed to accommodate non-smartphone users as well. 

There are two parts to the application:

Super User : The Supervisor/Manager will use the source android application to schedule, assign and follow up on the tasks. He / She can also use the interface to generate the reports and understand the availability/resource loading of his subordinates.

Subordinates : The Subordinates can use any phone to give their feedback on the task assigned. It could be through a missed call or sms in a particular format.

The application reads these feedback and updates the system. It also sends the timely reminders of the tasks assigned. This results in reduction of daily activity tracking through calls.

Scalable and collaborative in truest sense, PlanMan can be used in a wide spectrum of use cases from running a small business, to planning a weekend trip or arranging a birthday party.
